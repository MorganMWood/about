        <p>For current students at NC Wesleyan University, please refer to the <a href="students.html">For Current Students</a> page for more information.</p>
	<p>I have had the pleasure of teaching brilliant students across 8 different courses (17 different sections total) during my time at NC Wesleyan University, UNC Chapel Hill, and East Carolina University. Course Descriptions and syllabi for recently taught courses can be found below. For syllabi from before Spring 2023, including all courses taught at East Carolina University, please email me to request.</p>

<p><b>News:</b> Both the Minor in Data Science and the APS Certificate in Data Science at NC Wesleyan have been approved! Please contact me or the registrar's office if you would like more information on these exciting (and resume-boosting) opportunities.</p>

       <h3>NC Wesleyan's Data Science Program</h3>
<p>
I am proud to announce the availability of the <a href="https://catalog.ncwc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=5&poid=605&returnto=231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Science Minor</a> at NC Wesleyan University. In addition, we have established a Data Science Certificate through the Adult & Professional Studies (APS) program — with the certificate’s first cohort set to begin in Summer 2026. These new programs reflect our commitment to providing students with rigorous, market-relevant training in data analysis, computing, visualization, and decision-making skills. Feel free to email me or NC Wesleyan's registrar's office for more information.

       <h3>Past Courses</h3>

        <div class="course-box">
            <h3>COL 150: Using Data in Business</h3>
            <p>Fall 2025</p>
            <p>Course Catalog Description: Intended for first-year students at NCWU, this course is designed 
to invite students to participate in the university's academic life 
through the study of a discipline-specific issue, problem, or topic 
of interest. Taught by a member of NCWU's full-time faculty, the 
course will introduce students to a scholarly discipline through a 
specialized topic in which the faculty member possesses interest 
and expertise. Designed for students with little or no prior college 
experience, the course will also introduce and develop habits of 
mind that will help to foster success throughout students' careers 
at the university. <br>
This course, in particular, will serve as an introduction to modern 
data science techniques that can be used in business decision
making. These topics are either broad or advanced in nature, so 
instead of going into depth, we will only break the surface while 
giving a gentle introduction to each of the following topics: Data 
exploration (and basic coding), Simulation, Modeling using 
Machine Learning, Reinforcement learning, and Ethics.</p>

            <h3>MAT 213: Elementary Statistics</h3>
            <p>Fall 2025</p>
            <p>Course Catalog Description: Topics will include descriptive statistical techniques including 
sampling techniques, collection of data, frequency distributions, 
graphing of data and analysis of data (measures of central 
tendency, location and spread); introduction to relationships 
between quantitative variables (correlation and least squares 
regression); probability rules with known probability distributions 
such as binomial and normal distributions; introduction to 
statistical inference (confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and 
making predictions).</p>
