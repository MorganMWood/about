        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am Morgan Wood (previously Morgan Smith), an Assistant Professor of Business and Data Science at North Carolina Wesleyan University. I am passionate about advancing the field of Operations Management, with research focused on data-driven decision making in service operations. Much of my current and past research focuses on tracking and forecasting customer flows, exemplified through an ongoing collaboration with an international airport. I am openly seeking collaborations with researchers and firms, and would welcome the opportunity to chat. </p>
        <p>I hold a PhD in Statistics and Operations Research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as well as MA and BS degrees in Mathematics from East Carolina University and a MS degree in Statistics and Data Analytics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
	<p>I have been the instructor and/or teaching assistant for numerous undergraduate and Ph.D. courses on data analysis, stochastic modeling, and discrete mathematics. For information of the current courses that I am teaching, please see the 'For Current Students' tab.</p>
