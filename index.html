        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am Morgan Wood (previously Morgan Smith), a PhD candidate in Statistics and Operations Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am passionate about advancing the field of Operations Management, with research focused on data-driven decision making in service operations. Much of my current and past research focuses on tracking and forecasting customer flows, exemplified through an ongoing collaboration with an international airport. I am also interested in studying information sharing within platforms and service systems. </p>
        <p>I hold MA and BS degrees in Mathematics from East Carolina University and a MS degree in Statistics and Data Analytics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I have been the instructor and/or teaching assistant for numerous undergraduate and Ph.D. courses on data analysis, stochastic modeling, and discrete mathematics. </p>
        <p>I have had the great pleasure to be mentored by Serhan Ziya and Adam Mersereau from UNC Chapel Hill as well as Fernando Bernstein and Bora Keskin from Duke University throughout my PhD.</p>
        <p>I am on the academic job market in the 2024 - 2025 school year, and I look forward to sharing my research and teaching experiences with you.</p>
