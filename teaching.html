        <p>For current students of STOR 572: Simulation for Analytics, please refer to the <a href="students.html">For Current Students</a> page for more information.</p>
	<p>I have had the pleasure of teaching brilliant students across 6 different courses (14 different sections total) during my time at UNC Chapel Hill and East Carolina University. For syllabi from before Spring 2023, including all courses taught at East Carolina University, please email me.</p>

<p><b>News:</b> I have recently been awarded the 2023 Walter L. Deemer Excellence in Teaching Award from the UNC STOR department.</p>
