        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am Morgan Wood (previously Morgan Smith), an Assistant Professor of Business and Data Science at North Carolina Wesleyan University. I am passionate about developing data-driven methods that improve decision-making in service systems, particularly in settings where data is noisy or limited. My recent work focuses on tracking and forecasting customer flows and understanding the role of data quality in real-time operational decisions, motivated largely by an ongoing collaboration with a major international airport. Beyond research, I am actively involved in launching NC Wesleyan’s new Data Science program, designing and teaching courses across analytics, data visualization, statistical computing, and information technology.</p>
        <p>I hold a PhD in Statistics and Operations Research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as well as MA and BS degrees in Mathematics from East Carolina University and an MS in Statistics and Data Analytics from UNC Chapel Hill.</p>
	<p>I have taught and supported instruction across a range of undergraduate and graduate courses in data analysis, statistics, decision sciences, and discrete mathematics. For information about the courses I am currently teaching, please see the “For Current Students” tab.</p>
